# Promodoro App

I made a simple frontend promodoro timer⏱️ with reactjs and css. It consist of timer with start🟢 and stop🛑 button. If start button is clicked, the timer will run backwards🔙 from 25:00 and stops at 0:00 and again process continue if start button is clicked and user can stop🛑 the timer at any time the user wants.
